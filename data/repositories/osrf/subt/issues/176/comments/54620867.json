So ideally we could get it as result of simulation. For Tunnel Circuit we hacked it to dump it into `rosout.log` \u2026 which is a bit crazy, but it sometimes worked. That is the source where is see strange data from IMU or accelerometers. There are also images related to detected artifacts \u2026\n\nSo back to your question - by `final dump` I mean copy of this binary logfile. As far as I know docker can mount external disk \u2026 that could be one way. Another option is what Nate mentioned, so that we could call some Ignition function to upload the data \u2026 that is in the case when everything works fine. But mostly it does not, so very valuable are the data when robot end up somewhere up-side-down \u2026 \n\nIs this explanation better?\n\nthanks\n\nm.\n\n\u200c", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi Arthur,</p>\n<p>I am not sure what others use for debugging, but for us it is primarily OSGAR binary log file.
