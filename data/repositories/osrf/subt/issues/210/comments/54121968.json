For the submission of our solution we need a docker image for each robot. To be able to use the COPY command it seems that we need to copy the source-files in every docker-image-build-folder to have them available during the docker - build process. \n\nIs there a special option for using COPY or is there another solution for this?", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Thank you very much for the hint.
