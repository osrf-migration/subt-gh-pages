Cloudsim did not provide consistent imu data until sim time 299.  It looks like one message came through early and no more imu messages until time 299.\r\n3. Cloudsim imu data dropped out at time 362 and no futher imu data was available for the run.\r\n4. Ground truth data dropped out intermittently while in the start area  - 873 to 907 for example\r\n\r\nThese were the issues for the first vehicle.
