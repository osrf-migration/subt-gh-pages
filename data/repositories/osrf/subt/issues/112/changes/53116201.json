With this change, the teams will use the `/subt/pose_from_artifact_origin` service in the staging area to get the robot's location relative to the tunnel entrance. This will simplify the process of entering the tunnel faster at the start on the competition.\n\nWill this impact or benefit the development your SubT solution?  Thumb UP/DOWN?\n\nThank you in advance!", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi everyone,</p>\n<p>We're looking into moving the artifact origin to the center of the tunnel entrance to be consistent with the Systems Track competition.
