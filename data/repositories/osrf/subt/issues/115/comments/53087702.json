Two which we can\u2019t modify and will be part of your system described [here](#!/osrf/subt/wiki/tutorials/cloudsim). And the third image is the one that will contain our solution/controller, described [here](#!/osrf/subt/wiki/tutorials/SystemSetupDocker). This third image could be build using the sample Dockerfile in [this link](#!/osrf/subt/wiki/tutorials/SystemSetupDocker), is that correct? We basically have to do modifications to that Dockerfile in order to incorporate our solution, and this Dockerfile has also the gazebo-ignition installed. \n\nDoes this seem like what we need to do? The cloudsim description mentioned the third Solution Container but not how we are supposed to build it.  If we are not supposed to follow that Dockerfile for our Solution Container, could you provide a sample Dockerfile? \n\nThank you!", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi <span class=\"ap-mention\" data-atlassian-id=\"5cf75629ff02b50ea27b2817\">@Alfredo Bencomo</span> , </p>\n<p>They way I understand is that the system is composed of three images.
