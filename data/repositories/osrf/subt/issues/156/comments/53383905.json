Then I updated the tunnels and was able to reproduce it from a very specific pose. Not sure if the tunnels made a difference or if I just found the sweet spot. Then I moved the robot and never found it again. It would be nice to know a precise robot configuration and pose that we can use to reproduce this issue. Let me know if you have the numbers, @{557058:ba6a5dd6-99be-45af-a802-687b3318965a}.\n\nThe problem seems to be coming from the seam where 2 tunnels meet. I think it would be a good idea to have some overlap between the tunnels. We can do it either by moving the models a few millimeters closer, or extending the meshes by a few millimetres. The 1st option would slightly change the worlds, so I'll look into the 2nd one.
