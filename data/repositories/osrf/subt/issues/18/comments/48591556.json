You can setup subT following the tutorials in a base workspace, but you'd put all your own code in a different (overlayed) workspace. You can then source the `install/setup.bash` of the base workspace before you build your new workspace. I think it might be easier to show with commands:\n\n```\n$ mkdir ~/base_ws\n# follow instructions in the subT tutorial and install subT in base_ws\n# at some point, the setup will include the following\n$ source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash\n$ catkin_make install\n\n# Create a new workspace\n# this is your new workspace and you'd do all your development here.\n$ mkdir ~/overlay_ws\n# This part is important. Source the base workspace from the **install** directory\n$ source ~/base_ws/install/setup.bash\n# Use catkin build or catkin_make. Note that you don't have to install.\n$ catkin_make\n# source your new workspace\n$ source ~/overlay_ws/devel/setup.bash\n# From this point forward your don't have to source the base workspace unless you clean (delete build and/or devel) your workspace.\n```\n\nThis should work, but please beware of the warnings and limitations of ROS overlays from the [documentation](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/workspace_overlaying).", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>One way you can avoid doing <code>catkin_make install</code> is by using <a data-is-external-link=\"true\" href=\"http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/workspace_overlaying\" rel=\"nofollow\">workspace overlays</a>.
