For clarification in the screenshots, the X3 is shown as a small white box as opposed to a quadrotor.</p>", "type": "rendered"}, "assignee": {"display_name": "Mabel Zhang", "uuid": "{4b0e38fb-bf50-45c0-a496-61147518b2bf}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B4b0e38fb-bf50-45c0-a496-61147518b2bf%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B4b0e38fb-bf50-45c0-a496-61147518b2bf%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "https://avatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net/557058:ceb5942c-6843-408c-8550-3ce4899d299b/4d48e5ea-cf28-4fa7-9715-8fc9e315d831/128"}}, "nickname": "mabelmzhang", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:ceb5942c-6843-408c-8550-3ce4899d299b"}, "state": "closed", "version": null, "edited_on": null, "created_on": "2019-09-18T14:59:57.113328+00:00", "milestone": null, "updated_on": "2019-10-31T05:53:12.926333+00:00", "type": "issue", "id": 188}
