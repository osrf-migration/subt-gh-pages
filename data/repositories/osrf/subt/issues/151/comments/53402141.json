See this [PR](#!/osrf/subt/pull-requests/261) for more details. \\(tutorial will come after merge\\).\n\nQ4 & Q6. I suggest starting with this [tutorial](#!/osrf/subt/wiki/tutorials/CustomControl) as a \u201ctemplate\u201d.\n\nQ5. You can either create a single Docker image for all your agents \\(as shown in the above [PR](#!/osrf/subt/pull-requests/261)\\) or a Docker image for each agent. That is up to each team.\n\nQ7. No, the catkin install is NOT being deprecated. However, we do encourage teams to use the Docker image to run the SubT Virtual Simulator; while you continue developing your solution in your local catkin workspace and later spinning out Docker image\\(s\\) of your solution to be tested with [Docker Composer](https://docs.docker.com/compose) before submitting it onto the Clousim \\(as shown below\\).\n\nQ8. All of them.\n\nQ9.
