In any case, included for completeness:\n\n1. Give an overview of major changes from the gazebo9 subt. What should we expect to be the same and what should we expect to not be the same? Specifically, what functionalities were \\*deliberately\\* removed or altered?\n2. Make a transition guide with updates we may need to make to our code to account for \\*deliberate\\* changes \\(e.g. the tf tree/REP-105 issue\\)\n3. Give complete instructions on how you expect solutions to be presented: E.g. one docker container per robot on team, implemented in which docker container? Is the subt\\_shell container the base container? For each agent? Can you make a streamlined container that \\*only\\* has the packages in the tunnel\\_circuit branch that are allowed/required for interfacing with the subt simulation and bridge containers?\n4. How do you want us to launch our solution controller in our solution docker container? Is it ok to start our nodes with a launch file or are you expecting something else? \n5. Why do we need a different docker for each agent? Why can't we launch all controllers simultaneously with one launch file in one solution docker container? Asking primarily because this is different from how we develop in a catkin\\_ws. \n6. Do I need to learn how to build .ign files to launch my controller? \\(No, use the subt .ign files to launch the subt simulator and regular launch files to launch any ROS nodes you're interested in using\\)\n7. Is the catkin install being deprecated? Moving forward after the tunnel circuit will we be expected to do all development in dockers?\n8. Which tiles and artifact models in the Tech Repo are being used for the Tunnel Circuit competition?  \\(Answer is somewhere in the issues.\\)\n9. When should we expect a feature freeze for the tunnel circuit? What changes are you expecting to make between now and then?
