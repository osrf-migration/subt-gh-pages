It is true that once you close your container, all the changes are lost. What you can do is to save it as docker image. It will then hold that instance of your container.\n\n\u200c\n\ne.g.\n\n1. You have container c1 running,\n2. You made changes to some folder/files in it,\n3. store the container by the following command,  \n  `docker commit <CONTAINER_ID> <YOUR_GIVEN_IMAGE_NAME>:<TAG_NAME>`  \n  you can get the CONTAINER\\_ID by running `docker ps` and choose the image name as you wish. What I found earlier that `run.bash` script searches for the image with the tag name as `latest`. So, you can run the command as below,  \n  `docker commit fed9418314dc my_image:latest`  \n  and your image is ready with all your changes.\n4. Next time you use your custom image by using `./run.bash my_image` and you will get all your changes there. This is how I used to keep my changes intact previously.\n\nI need to check the current methods though. You can create a number of images like that to retain your different changes.\n\n\u200c\n\nHope it helps.
