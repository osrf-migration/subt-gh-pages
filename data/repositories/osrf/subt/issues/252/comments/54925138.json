I ran into a few issues while following the instructions posted by @Angela Maio, specifically the instructions \u2018Adding a Custom Configuration to Existing Vehicles\u2019 in step 4, and the generation of a URDF.  I\u2019m curious to know if anyone else is having similar issues.\n\nThe instructions mentioned in step 4 refer to a specific branch of osrf/sdformat. In order to get the specific branch I followed the instructions for compiling from source found [here](http://sdformat.org/tutorials?tut=install) with the following exception:\n\nI replaced this line:\n\n```\nhg up sdf_2.0\n```\n\nWith the clone command from the branch:\n\n```\nhg pull && hg update sdf_to_urdf_sdf8\n```\n\nThe first step in these instructions tells you to remove sdformat. When I did this, a lot of associated ignition stuff was also going to be removed. I went ahead and did this because the machine I was using was not our primary subt development machine, but this is unfortunate. Would it work to build this branch from source without removing pre-existing sdformat?\n\nTo build, this specific branch of sdformat requires g\\+\\+ 8, which I made sure was installed:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install g++-8\n```\n\nMy machine \\(Ubuntu 18.04\\) was still defaulting to g\\+\\+ 6.5, so I had to export the environment variables to get sdformat to build:\n\n```\nexport CXX=g++-8\n\n# and for good measure, not sure if it's necessary because\n# I wasn't getting any errors about gcc\nexport CC=gcc-8\n```\n\nsdformat was then able to build and I got the option to use the -u tag on ign sdf, which does not show up in other branches of sdformat. I passed in my model.sdf file and the output was printed to the terminal.\n\nI followed the other instructions without any problem. I am still waiting on a response to the pull request to ensure everything is set up correctly.\n\nTakeaway questions: Is this the best or intended way to go about generating the URDF file? If so, is removing sdformat before installing from source with the new branch absolutely necessary?\n\n\u200c", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Yesterday I submitted a request for the new X4 configuration that <span class=\"ap-mention\" data-atlassian-id=\"557058:21a4b3d0-2fa2-4202-9385-337ffcf40b2f\">@Neil Johnson</span> and I have been working on.
