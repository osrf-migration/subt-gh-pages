Add functionality to the CommsClient so that it periodically sends a broadcast packet and monitors the reception of such packets to populate the neighbor list. This is similar to the BEACON in 802.11 (adhoc or station mode).\n2. Add the hooks to pass received signal strength on each of these BEACON packets up to the CommsClient. Again, this is similar to what most 802.11 drivers implement (i.e., the output of `iw dev wlan0 station dump`). Most radios provide something like this functionality and it would be useful/necessary in most comms-aware algorithms.\n\nPlease speak up if you have any thoughts or comments.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>We have a change of plans, which is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add functionality to the CommsClient so that it periodically sends a broadcast packet and monitors the reception of such packets to populate the neighbor list.
