We want to know if we can move the placement of sensors on the vehicles to locations/orientations that make sense for our CONOPs.  Right now, the main sensor we want to move is the RGBD camera on the X4 vehicle.  It points downward by 15 degrees, such that when we move forward, it looks mostly at the ground.  We want to reverse this pitch angle to compensate for steady-state pitch angle, but that will make it see the props.  So, we plan to pitch it up and raise it up and forward of the prop line.
