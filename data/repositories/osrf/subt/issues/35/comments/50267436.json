I do not meat to communicate via ROS topic directly robot2robot. I mean to talk to a device \"mounted on each robot\". This device can be maybe simulated in Gazebo??\n\nAnother issue is what to do, if we use Python code and not C/C++. For the first experiment we compiled small C code which communicated to the base, where Python code saves a file and C-code reports it ... but accidentally in the example setup there are 4 robots & 4 controllers, so the report was actually invalidly reported by all robots, including the once waiting in start area.\n\nAny suggestion how to integrate Python code? We can have multiple different instances of C-code reporters, but maybe there is better solution??", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I am still not sure if we understand each other.
