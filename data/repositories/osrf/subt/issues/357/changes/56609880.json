So the joints and links appear to be setup properly in the SDF file \\(see attached file - I have only set up the pan linkage for now, tilt will be added once I get this figured out\\), but now I am unsure of how to subscribe or publish to the joint states. All tutorials/resources like the joint\\_state\\_publisher need an URDF rather than an SDF. So my questions are as follows, and if anyone has any insight or resources I can take a look at that would be very helpful so thank you in advance!\r\n\r\n* Would it work just to create/edit a URDF to mirror my current SDF, then throw that into the joint\\_state\\_publisher, or will that not work because ignition is actually using our SDF model rather than the URDF?\r\n* Is there another node or package I can configure to interface directly with the SDF joints?\r\n* Is there a ros\\_ign\\_bridge for joints?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m new to making my own SDF\u2019s and URDFs so apologies in advance.\r\n\r\n\u200c", "old": "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nWe are trying to submit a new robot which has an rgbd camera on the end on a pan tilt gimbal but I have run into a problem.
