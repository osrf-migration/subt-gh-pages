The base station is run alongside simulation, and doesn't have access to ros::Time. This is why the CommsClient has a new \"isBasestation\" variable and listens to simulation's clock topic. I think this should be fine for teams. If they accidentally declare their client as \"isBasestation\", then they will try to subscribe to the clock, but the topic won't be available.\r\n\r\n2. At first, I thought the /pose topic was missing static objects, and the GameLogicPlugin was never getting the pose of the artifacts. This lead me to make the GameLogicPlugin a SystemPlugin. However, I later realized that levels would only publish poses of objects that are loaded. I left the GameLogicPlugin as a system plugin, because I think it's slightly more efficient.\r\n\r\n3.
